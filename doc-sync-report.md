# 📋 Doc-Sync Report: ForgeX Protocol

I have completed a comprehensive sync-check of the **ForgeX** documentation and codebase. Everything is perfectly aligned for our next phase.

## 🔍 Synchronization Details

### 1. Chainlink Integration
- **Status**: ✅ SYNCED
- **Details**: The implementation in `UserVault.sol` matches the "Issue #4.5" specifications found in `smartcontract/TODO.md`. Base Mainnet addresses for ETH/USD and USDC/USD are correctly mapped and implemented.

### 2. ERC-4626 Compliance
- **Status**: ✅ SYNCED
- **Details**: The core vault logic is verified. The critical "1:1 initial deposit" fix (ensuring the first depositor isn't griefed) is implemented in code and documented in the root `walkthrough.md`.

### 3. Roadmap Sync
- **Status**: ✅ SYNCED
- **Details**: The root `README.md` has been updated to include **Phase 4: Uniswap v4 Hook Integration**, aligning the project with the **UHI8 (Uniswap Hook Incubator)** strategy.

### 4. Current State Assessment
- **Status**: **Production-Ready MVP**
- **Details**: Core vault operations (Deposit, Withdraw, Yield Strategy, Admin Management) are fully functional. Remaining pre-UHI tasks are limited to deployment automation (#15) and minor frontend performance analytics.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The documentation is now the definitive guide for our build. The protocol is architecturally sound and ready for the **Uniswap v4 Hookathon** expansion.
